Belly Button Challenge
  For this challenge in our bootcamp, we were tasked with creating an interactive dashboard to show the biodiversity of microbial species that live in belly buttons. To create my dashboard, I used my past class resources, collaborated with a couple of classmates (Kiet and Katie), consulted AskBCS Assistant, and utilized both Xpert Learning Assistant and ChatGPT. 
  The interactive charts update everytime you change the sample in the dropdown menu. Enjoy!
